ERC20Minimal.sol

1)Missing checks for amount is != zero in the transfer and transferFrom functions.

2)The logic for updating the allowance in transferFrom should handle the case where the allowance is less than the amount being transferred.

3)Ensure that the user has a sufficient balance before transferring or burning tokens.

Multicall.sol

1)"memory-safe" is not a valid option. "memory-safe" is not a valid specifier within an assembly block in Solidity. The correct use of assembly in Solidity does not involve such specifiers.Therefore should be removed.

ERC1155Minimal.sol

1)The function safeBatchTransferFrom assumes that ids and amounts arrays have the same length but does not explicitly check this.Adding this length check ensures that the function operates as intended and prevents logical errors, improving the robustness and security of the contact. Recomendation: Add a check to ensure ids and amounts arrays have the same length.

2)Ensure amount to mint or burn is greater than zero and that the balance is sufficient for burning.

InteractionHelper.sol

1)In the doApprovals function, the approve calls do not handle potential failures. Although most ERC20 tokens should conform to the standard and not fail, it's good practice to check the return value of approve calls to ensure the approval succeeded.

2)The unchecked block in computeName is not performing any arithmetic operations, so it is unnecessary here.
